1. what is github ?

=> GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you 
   and others work together on projects from anywhere.


2. what is git ?

=> git is version control system.

=> It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large
   projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling 
   multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.


3. what is difference between git and github ?

=>   Git is a software.	
    GitHub is a service.

=>  Git is a command-line tool. 
    GitHub is a graphical user interface.

=>  Git is installed locally on the system.
	 GitHub is hosted on the web

=>  Git is focused on version control and code sharing.	
    GitHub is focused on centralized source code hosting.

=>  Git is a version control system to manage source code history. 
    GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories.


4. what is version control ?

=> A version controls system records all the changes made to a file or set of files, so 
   that specific version called later if needed 

=> let take an example, multinational company that has office and employee all around the 
   world. so they might be challenges and issue they face.

   possible issue and challenges :

   # challenges to collaboration
   - there are so many people, they working on same project but different region(country)

   # storing version 
   - the project is not completed on single version. there may be n number of version 
     in that situation the problem of storing all such commits in single place is 
     huge challenges
    
   # restoring previous version '
   - sometime is important to go back to the previous version to find root cause any bug

   # figure out what happended : 
   - at time it is cirtical to know what change we made previous version code.

  THIS ALL PROBLEM SOLUTION IS VERSION Control

  => version control system take care collaboration between employees, will help in 
     having backups on the remote repository. it also help rolling back to the previous
     commits  
    

meaning of version control  : 

=> A version controls system records all the changes made to a file or set of files, so 
   that specific version called later if needed 

=> it is responiabilty of version control system to keep all the team member on the same 
   page, it make sure every team member works on latest version of the file 

=> The Version Control System helps manage the source code for the software team by 
   keeping track of all the code modifications

=> example: let say one company working with one project with 3 developer from diffrent 
  location. there is one repository acting as server. there are 3 developer means workStation
  here each workstation has their own working copy and all the workstation saving the code 
  into particular server repository. this makes easy for any devloper access the task being  
  done using the repository. in case the system any particular developer breakdown then work 
  won't stop. there will be copy or source code in that central repository



now whatever you have file inside of git. it will store the changed also h(history).

git and github are different.

to download any repository from github

how to upload code in github :

step 1 : go to particular repository which you want to download 
         select code dropdown menu 
         copy http link 
         eg. https://github.com/mananpadhiyar/Edureka.git

step 2 : create folder where you want to store that responiabilty data

      like edureka folder
      go inside open cmd 
      type 
      git clone <paste http Link>


step:3 open git Bash 

go to folder where you have added to git clone by using cd 

cd f:
cd /crypto-hunder-folder
cd /crypto-hunder

once find main 

then write => git status 

it shows your which folder or file are added or not
if added then it will show it green
if not will show it red 

to add file or folder

git add * 

it will add all the file / folder 

git commit -m "description" 

then it order to add the changing run this command



How to push project folder to github directly from vs code

#1 create repository first in github account

 copy the url of created repository 

#2 go to the vs code => click => source control

after clickly you will see message input there you need to write commit of project

you will have ... in upside click on it => go => push/pull => push => add remote 

in add remote you need to paste the url that you copied from the github 

then press Enter

then need to add remote name like project  

then again go to that push/pull option => go => push to 

now their will be already have link that we have pasted over here 

just click on it


## how github works actually ?

=> let take an example we facebook source code 

=> so need to store in github for that we can create repository for that and store their.

# what is repository ?
=> a repository is a central file storage location. It is used by version control systems 
   to store multiple versions of files. 

=> that respository we called as HEAD 


now lets say we need to change something in project for that we have created 3 teams 
1 team for changing login/signup page , 2 team home page , 3 team is for footer part 

now for that we have Created Branch 

now what is Branch ?

=> Branch is complete replica(copy) of head
=> Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas \
   in a contained area of your repository. 


































  git push origin

we can create our own Branch
like we are making changing in this months so i will create branch name like => 
=> v202307015FBlogin

now lets say our team one done with login branch

now here team2 needed team1 code in order to work 

so here team1 will go their branch click on update option 

their team2 can access the code of team 1


how to push the changes in github ?

just like we do push source code from vs code to github

after pushing code to github

when you make some changes in code 

you will see M symbol in file  that nothing changes you made show but didn't push on github

for that go => git icon => their you will see what changes you made

give their commits

then click on right symbol => click => yes 

after clicking yes process will start

for adding those changes simple click on 3 dots  => pull to =>automatically open url of github 

if it is not their then copy from github past over here

enter that it.
